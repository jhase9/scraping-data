Python that scrapes and aggregates recent job postings from a few journalism job posting sites. Jobs are then searchable by keyword, location, etc. Also (just for kicks) creates a chart showing location by U.S. state of jobs posted.

I'd recommend using it with Jupyter Notebook instead of Terminal/Command Prompt - the output is ugly in the latter - but to each their own. 

Extra things used:

- pandas
- BeautifulSoup
- matplotlib
- webbrowser

Enjoy!
